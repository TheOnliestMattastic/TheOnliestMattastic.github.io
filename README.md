# Matthew Poole Chicano  

Hey there! 👋 I’m Matthew — a **CompTIA A+ certified** IT enthusiast who’s spent most of my life writing stories, designing games, and solving puzzles that *actually work*. You’ll find me troubleshooting systems with the same curiosity I use to craft a compelling scene or debug a character’s motivation.

## 📐 Projects

### 🔐 **My Bash Automation Toolkit**  
I wrote scripts that do backups, cleanup, and file sync *automatically* (using cron, Rclone, Timeshift).  
**Why it’s special**: Instead of asking users “*Do I need to manually back up this?*,” the system runs quietly in the background — like a friend who remembers your coffee order. 🔥 *Saved 3+ hours/week, zero data loss.*  

### 🎮 **Battle Tactics Arena** (CS50 Final Project)  
*2D strategy game in Lua*: Used OOP and state machines to make turn-based gameplay feel intuitive — no confusing menus or crashes.  
**Real-life takeaway**: *This is exactly how I approach system recovery*. When a user’s OS freezes, I reframe it as “*What’s the next state?*” — then rebuild from there.  

### 🏰 **Temples & Trolls** (UE5 RPG)  
*Ongoing project*: I’m building an RPG where every crash is a story clue. Through user tests, I’ve cut critical crashes by **50%** by designing *anticipatory* fixes (like adding “save points” for system failures).

## 🌱 Why I’m Here (and How My Background Helps)

I didn’t get into IT through a corporate job — I built it through **real life**:  
- As a **military HR clerk**, I learned to document workflows so clearly they’d *never* get lost (now I turn system errors into playbooks).  
- When fixing café POS printers during a relocation, I realized **empathy beats technical jargon** — *you* need to understand *why* something fails before you fix it.  
- My creative writing and psychology background taught me to spot patterns in user frustration (like how game crashes happen *before* the user even notices).  

This isn’t “just IT.” It’s about **solving problems with care** — whether it’s a frozen Linux boot or a user who can’t find their files.

## 🔧 How I work

- **Document-first**: Troubleshooting with reproducible steps and playbooks.  
- **Automation-first**: Reducing manual work with scripts and scheduled jobs.  
- **Empathetic support**: Translating technical problems into clear, actionable guidance for non-technical users.
