Welcome to my page! I'm a solo **indie game developer** and **IT support** candidate who turns curiosity into working systems and playable worlds. I grew up glued to my computer screen and channeled that obsession into building and upgrading desktops, learning Windows inside out, and now developing an open-world RPG in **Unreal Engine** with **C++**.  

I’m **CompTIA A+ certified**, a lifelong self-learner, and a tinkerer who loves finding problems, fixing them, and documenting the process so others can learn too.  

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🐱 powerCat — A Single‑Shot Concatenator

> A PowerShell module I authored and published to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/powerCat). It bundles source code and documentation files into one clean, shareable text file - perfect for recruiters, collaborators, or feeding into LLMs.  
**Features:** recursion, Markdown code fencing, extension filters, sorting, and ergonomic aliases (`powerCat`, `pcat`, `concat`).  
**Built with:** PowerShell, Pester (automated tests), GitHub Actions (CI/CD).

## 🌌 Values

I care about clear education, fair wages, and the struggle against class and income inequality. I bring those values into collaborative projects, documentation that reduces barriers to entry, and code that’s meant to teach as much as it runs.
