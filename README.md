## 🧩 Projects & Portfolio

### 🔥 **My Bash Automation Toolkit**
[View repo](https://github.com/TheOnliestMattastic/My-Bash-Toolkit)  
A collection of scripts for backup, cleanup, file sync (cron, Rclone, Timeshift).  
**Why I’m proud:** It works in the background—like a friend who remembers your coffee order and just gets things done.  
_What I learned:_ Automating IT tasks, reducing manual errors, and making systems reliable.

### 🎮 **Battle Tactics Arena (Prototype)**
*Turn-based strategy (Lua + LÖVE framework). Not yet uploaded, but ask me about it!*  
**Why I’m proud:** Designed intuitive gameplay logic and OOP patterns.  
_What I learned:_ To approach system recovery and debugging as a series of logical game states.

### 🏰 **Solo UE5 Open-World RPG (Ongoing)**
Building an ambitious open-world RPG in Unreal Engine 5, solo.  
**Why I’m excited:** It’s teaching me large-scale project planning, asset management, C++ architecture, and iterative user testing.

### 📊 **Psychology Research: Impact of Tobacco on BP & HR**
[View repo](https://github.com/TheOnliestMattastic/Psychology-Research-Impact-of-Tobacco-on-BP-and-HR)  
Reproducible data analysis of smoking effects on blood pressure and heart rate.  
_What I learned:_ Data wrangling, reproducibility, and technical writing for non-experts.
