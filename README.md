# The One & Onliest Mattastic

**CompTIA A+ certified** IT Support candidate with hands-on experience in Linux/Windows system optimization, Bash automation scripting, and SOHO networking. I build intuitive, user-focused solutions by translating creative problem-solving from game development, psychology, and real-world roles — including military/non-profit client support and retail inventory audits — into measurable outcomes.
