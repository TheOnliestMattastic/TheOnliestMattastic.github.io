## 🚀 Featured Projects  

- **🐱 powerCat (PowerShell, Pester, GitHub Actions)** — Published a professional‑grade PowerShell module with automated testing and CI/CD, streamlining code/documentation bundling for recruiters and collaborators.  
- **🧰 Bash Toolkit (Bash, rclone, cron)** — Built and documented a suite of portable scripts to automate repetitive system tasks, reducing manual overhead and improving reliability.  
- **📊 Tobacco & Vital Signs Research (R, ggplot2, R Markdown)** — Conducted statistical modeling and data visualization on smoking’s impact on blood pressure/heart rate, producing a reproducible, published report.  
- **👾 Open‑World RPG (Unreal Engine, C++, Blender, Krita)** — Designing and developing core gameplay systems and procedural encounters as a solo dev, demonstrating long‑term project management and creative problem‑solving.  

## ✨ Skills Snapshot  

**Core Spikes (Depth):**  

- **Automation & Scripting:** PowerShell (module publishing, Pester testing, CI/CD pipelines), Bash (automation workflows)  
- **DevOps & Workflow:** GitHub Actions, version control (Git/GitHub), reproducible reporting  

**Supporting Skills (Breadth):**  

- **Web & Documentation:** HTML/CSS, Markdown (repo branding, technical docs, reproducible reports)  
- **Game Development & Creative Tools:** C++ (Unreal Engine 5), Lua (LÖVE2D), Blender, Krita  
- **IT Support & Systems:** Windows 10/11, Linux (Nobara/Fedora, Pop!_OS), macOS; POS/device setup; end‑user training  

## 🧬 About Me  

I’m a **versatile technologist** who thrives at the intersection of **IT support, automation, and creative development**. Think of me as a **generalist with spikes**:  

- **Breadth:** I’ve worn many hats—supporting end‑users, troubleshooting POS systems, writing documentation, and building indie games.  
- **Depth:** My strongest spike is in **automation and scripting**—publishing PowerShell modules, building CI/CD pipelines, and writing ergonomic tools that save time and reduce friction.  

I’m **CompTIA A+ certified**, a lifelong tinkerer, and a believer in making tech accessible, memorable, and human‑friendly.  

## 🔭 Current Focus  

- Expanding automation coverage for support tasks and deployment workflows  
- Polishing repo branding and READMEs to highlight problem‑solving and impact  
- Developing my open‑world RPG in Unreal Engine (C++ gameplay systems, devlog roadmap)  
- Maintaining a cohesive visual identity across repos (ASCII headers, badges, README cards)  

## 🌌 Values  

I believe in **clear education, fair wages, and reducing barriers to entry in tech**. My code is written to teach as much as it runs, and my documentation is designed to empower others.
