Welcome to my page! I'm a solo **indie game developer** and **IT support** candidate who turns curiosity into working systems and playable worlds. I grew up glued to my computer screen and channeled that obsession into building and upgrading desktops, learning Windows inside out, and now developing an open-world RPG in **Unreal Engine** with **C++**.  

I’m **CompTIA A+ certified**, a lifelong self-learner, and a tinkerer who loves finding problems, fixing them, and documenting the process so others can learn too.  

## 🚀 Featured Projects

## 🌠 Values

I care about clear education, fair wages, and the struggle against class and income inequality. I bring those values into collaborative projects, documentation that reduces barriers to entry, and code that’s meant to teach as much as it runs.
