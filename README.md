* **No Build Step Required**: Just edit the HTML file and your site is live. No command line, no compilers.
* **GitHub Pages Ready**: Follow the steps below to host this for free on GitHub.

## 🚀 Blasting Off: Your 5-Minute Portfolio

Follow these steps to get your own free portfolio website up and running.

### Step 1: Get the Code (Choose One Way)

#### Option A: Fork the Repository (Recommended)

This is the best option if you have a GitHub account. A "fork" is simply a personal copy of a project.

1. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of this page.
2. A copy of this repository will be created in your own GitHub account.

#### Option B: Download the ZIP File

Use this option if you don't use Git or GitHub.

1. Click the green **Code** button on this page.
2. Click **Download ZIP**.
3. Unzip the file on your computer. You will need to create your own GitHub repository and upload these files to it.

### Step 2: Rename Your Repository for GitHub Pages

This is the magic step that tells GitHub to turn your code into a live website.

1. In your new repository, click the **Settings** tab.
2. Under the "General" settings, find the "Repository name" field.
3. Rename the repository to **`your-username.github.io`**, replacing `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

    > **IMPORTANT**: The name must be *exact*. If your username is `jane-doe`, the repository name must be `jane-doe.github.io`.

### Step 3: Customize Your Content

Now it's time to make the portfolio your own!

1. In your repository, open the `index.html` file.
2. Click the **pencil icon** to edit the file directly in GitHub.
3. Look for the big comment blocks and the 🔧 emoji—these are your instructions!

Here is a checklist of things to personalize:

* **[ ] Browser Tab**: Change the `<title>` to your name.
* **[ ] SEO Description**: Update the `<meta name="description">` so search engines can find you.
* **[ ] Header**:
  * **[ ] Your Name & Tagline**: Update the `<h1>` and `<h2>` tags.
  * **[ ] Badges**: Change the links for your resume, GitHub, email, etc.
* **[ ] About Me**: Rewrite the introduction in the first `project-card`.
* **[ ] Projects**:
  * Edit the existing project cards with your own work.
  * To add a new project, just copy and paste an entire `project-card sub` block.
* **[ ] Skills, Experience, Achievements**: Fill these sections with your own details.
* **[ ] Contact**: Update the final call to action and contact badges.

### Step 4: Your Site is Live

That's it! Once you save your changes to `index.html`, GitHub will automatically publish your website.

Your new portfolio will be live at **`https://your-username.github.io`**.

> **Note**: It can sometimes take a few minutes for the website to appear or for changes to update. Be patient!

## 🧪 Advanced Customization (Optional)

If you're feeling adventurous, you can customize even more:

* **Change the Colors**: Open the `style.css` file to edit the color variables at the top. The file includes comments to guide you.
* **Update Your Resume**: Replace the `resume.pdf` file in the `/assets/docs/` folder with your own.
* **Change the Favicons**: Follow the instructions in `index.html` to change the little icons that appear in the browser tab.
* **Change the Theme Toggle Emojis**: The instructions in `index.html` explain how to change the 🌞 and 🌛 icons in both the HTML and the script at the bottom of the file.
